## Overview

This read me is about the weapon grips and how to tweak various weapon attributes.

## Instructions

1. **Choose Your Grip:**
    - Navigate to the `stream` folder.
    - Select and open the folder of the grip you want to use.
    - Drag the selected .ytds out of its folder and directly into the `stream` directory.
    `Note that as of right now, you will recieve the files with the stream folder holding the contents of the ivory white grip.`

2. **Tweak Weapon Attributes:**
    - Open the `weaponsinfo.meta` file.
    - You can adjust several parameters such as:
      - **Damage**
      - **Range**
      - **Dismemberment**

3. **Chane the weapon name:**
    - You can change the weapon name in the vanilla game ui ( weapon wheel, when cleaning the gun etc.)
    - Other things you must change to make the gun as realistic as possible and fit with your server:
        - vorp inventory config/weapons.lua
        - you weapons and gunsmith script
        - Any other script that can handle inventories or store uis and such.

If you need further assistance or want to include more features, please reach out to Mosquito Scripts.
