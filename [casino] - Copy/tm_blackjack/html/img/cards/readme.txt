to add more deckstyles, just go to https://github.com/femga/rdr3_discoveries/tree/master/useful_info_from_rpfs/textures/ui_minigames/cards
and download a deck style. You can replace the my own made deck with the original graphics then. 
Or make your own like shown in the folder "playing_cards_01".
Numbering is important as the integer behind "playing_cards_0" will be defined in your config file for each table.

"deckStyle = 1" will look for images in "playing_cards_01" ,
"deckStyle = 2" will look for images in "playing_cards_02" ,
(etc)
