# rms-herbs

### Requirements

* rsg-core
---
A plant picking and spawning system for RedM/RSG

It will spawn plants configured places, and allow players to walk up to them and pick them for inventory items.
A cooldown for each spot will be initiated afterward - this can be either configured per node, or on a global level (or both)!
During cooldown you can choose if the prompt is still be visible but greyed out and unuseable, or not visible at all via the config.

Pretty straightforward. Config is documented for your ease.
