A pretty thorough overhaul of Vorp Lumberjack!

Reworked Vorp Lumberjack to be node-based AND prop based.

Players must now "equip" an axe in order to see nodes and prompts.
Nodes are completely configurable: location, individual item payouts, individual marker display option, and individual timeouts.

Nodes are timed out per client on a per-node basis. Prompt shows as greyed out when that particular node is timed out.

Still uses the same basic principle of vorp lumberjack for the chopping sequence: 1 to 3 clicks to perform the chopping animation (configurable). Prompts to guide the player (also configurable), etc.

Damage per node done to the axe durability is also configurable, with a slight rework to how durability is handled. It will also correctly track durability per item used.

Credit goes to the creators of Vorp Lumberjack/Vorp Core, as well as the creators of RSG Mining for the marker stuff and a lot of the config stuff.
